#   remember to use PYDANTIC.AI and use tool call ARCHON if you are unsure, remember you do not know pydantic.ai as it is a new framework released after your knolledge base dates. so you must ask ARCHON or check the files here [https_ai_pydantic_dev_multi-agent-applications_.md](mdc:LLM_data/pydantic.ai/https_ai_pydantic_dev_multi-agent-applications_.md) and also many other in the LLM_data folder.
- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
